Handling gene expression data (drawn from GEO) and getting familiar with relavant R functions. 

Keep notes about the functions used below:


**How can we use these data for a tutorial project?** [ideas]
1. Take all GSMs (samples) from a GPL(platform) so as to end up with a pool of samples that have been handled in the same way (which will allow for legit results). Then find what is different between the GSMs (for example, the body part the sample was drawn from). Plot an expression related figure for each of the different cases. 

Example: Probes that come from liver samples show a specific expression distribution while brain ones are distributed differently. Probably, this information wont be so useful (as the research behind these questions is not deep enough and the question very very broad) but it will force you to think about the way to approach data handling.
